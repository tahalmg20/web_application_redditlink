Risk Identification

Risk 1: Unauthorized access to the VPC and EC2 instances.

Impact: Data leakage, data integrity compromise.
Probability: Medium.
Mitigation measures: VPC ACLs, EC2 security groups, VPC flow logs and monitoring, regular updates of EC2 instances.
Risk 2: Unauthorized access to Lambda functions.

Impact: Data leakage, data integrity compromise.
Probability: Medium.
Mitigation measures: Principle of least privilege, IAM policies, AWS X-Ray.
Risk 3: Unauthorized access to S3 buckets.

Impact: Data leakage, data integrity compromise.
Probability: High.
Mitigation measures: Restrict public access, IAM policies, server-side encryption (SSE), access logging.
Risk 4: Unauthorized access to the ELK Stack.

Impact: Data leakage, data integrity compromise.
Probability: Medium.
Mitigation measures: Strong passwords, authentication mechanisms, access management policies.
Risk 5: Administration protocols (RDP, SSH) exposed directly to the internet.

Impact: Unauthorized access, system compromise.
Probability: Medium.
Mitigation measures: Do not expose administration protocols directly to the internet, restrict access to a strictly authenticated and authorized population.
Risk 6: Unencrypted root EBS volumes on EC2 instances.

Impact: Data leakage, data integrity compromise.
Probability: Medium.
Mitigation measures: Encrypt root EBS volumes on all EC2 instances.
